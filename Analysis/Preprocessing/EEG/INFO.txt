### README --- NEVRO preprocessing
#
# A brief overview over the preprocessing steps in the NeVRo project.
# 
# For more details please look into the single scripts/functions. Ideally, there will be more detailled comments in the code soon.

NVR__preprocess.m:    runs the full preprocessing pipeline over all data sets by calling the single helper functions. It does this in seperate iterations for (a) the movement ("mov") vs. 
                      the non-movement ("nomov") condition as well as (b) either including ("SBA" := Space Coaster + Break + Andes Coaster) or excluding ("SA") the break. Normally, you 
					  will want to uncomment some steps or conditions you're not interested in. 

Helpers:
NVR_00_cutParts.m:    Divide EEG data SETs into mov and nomov parts.
                      [Should not be necessary any more unless modified.]

NVR_01.checkSet.m:    Check the data SETs for integrity (all markers present?)
                      [Should not be necessary any more unless modified.]

NVR_02_DS_PREP.m:    Downsample to 250Hz and run PREP pipeline (Bigdely-Shamlo et al., 2015) for standardized preprocessing

NVR_03_crop.m:    Crop data to relevant episodes (SPACE -- BREAK -- ANDES)

NVR_04_eventsARO.m:    Add individual arousal "events" (relevant for binary analysis).

NVR_05_1_prep4ICA.m:    "helpershelper" - this function is normally only called by NVR_05_ICA.m, however, due to it's visualization feature it can be handy to get a (data set by data set) 
                        overview over which parts of the data will be (automatically) marked as "noisy" and excluded from ICA decomposition. 
						Importantly, if this function marked more than 30% of the epochs as noisy, we excluded the data set from further analyses downstream.

NVR_05_ICA.m:    Run ICA decomposition (default: Infomax; can be changed via <varargin>) on the "cleaned" (noisy epochs removed) data

NVR_06_rejcomp.m:    Perform semi-manual rejection of noisy ICA components, guided by the SASICA plugin (Chaumon et al., 2015) for EEGLAB and reproject the ICA weights onto the full data set 
                     (including the "noisy" epochs) to keep the temporal continuity and same length of data sets for all participants.
